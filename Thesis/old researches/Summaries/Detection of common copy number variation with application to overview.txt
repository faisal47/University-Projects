Paper:
Detection of common copy number variation with application to
population clustering from next generation sequencing data
[Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2012 ; 2012: 1246â€“1249. doi:10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346163]

In this paper we work for the CNV detection part only. First datas from six samples have been applied on Depths of Coverage (DOC) method to detect
their CNVs'. Then this outputs are applied later to detect their common CNVs'. This method also gives the genomic coordinates of those detected CNVs'.
First the DOC profile is made from BAM files. And the algorithm works on the DOC profiles.
